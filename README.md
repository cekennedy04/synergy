# Synergy

Joint-kinematics research project comparing two simultaneous gait-recording methods captured
while a subject walks, to compute a synergy index between them:

- **OpenCap** — video-based pose estimation feeding an OpenSim musculoskeletal simulation.
  OpenCap and OpenSim come from the same group; OpenCap handles video → human pose estimation,
  OpenSim does the biomechanical simulation (muscle activations, joint torques, moment arms,
  back-computed joint angles).
- **Xsens body suit** ("exsense" in early notes) — worn simultaneously with the OpenCap
  recording, gives joint angles directly and more precisely than OpenCap.

The current analysis pipeline is manual and takes ~15 steps per trial. The goal of this project
is to automate it: loop through a batch of recordings and run the full pipeline on each one
without hand-driving every step.

The gait-cycle-segmentation portion of the pipeline is built on top of the
[OpenCap GitHub repo](https://github.com/opencap-org/opencap-processing) (a large portion of
this codebase is inherited from there — vendored directly into this repo; see `VENDORING.md`),
which already contains the logic for detecting when steps happen — splitting a walking trial
into strides from heel-strike to heel-strike (heel strike → single support → swing → next
heel strike).

## Pipeline

1. **Xsens → OpenSim format.** Convert Xsens kinematics (`.mvnx`) into the `.mot` format
   OpenSim expects, so Xsens data can run through the same downstream code as OpenCap data.
   Requires mapping each Xsens joint to its corresponding OpenCap/OpenSim joint (currently done
   in MATLAB).
2. **Gait-cycle segmentation.** Feed the `.mot` file into the existing OpenCap-derived code that
   finds heel-strike events and splits the trial into 0–100% gait cycle, per joint, producing a
   table of motion files.
3. **Apply to scaled model.** Use a subject-scaled OpenSim model (scaled by height/weight) with
   both the OpenCap-derived and Xsens-derived motion data, so the two sources are comparable on
   the same model.
4. **Repackage into an OpenCap session.** OpenCap sessions download as a zip with a 32-char
   session-ID descriptor. Extract it, replace the motion files inside the kinematics folder
   (one subfolder for OpenCap results, one for Xsens-derived results), then re-zip for upload
   back into the gait analysis backend.

## Known issues / open problems

- **Zip handling is fragile.** File-finding by name (motion files, session metadata) breaks if
  filenames get mangled on re-zip, or if files end up nested deeper than the code expects.
- **Session ID parsing is inconsistent.** The session ID must be retained in the filename, but
  the format varies — ID alone, ID + `.zip`, or an extra underscore — and index-based parsing
  is the main source of bugs here.
- **Login requirement.** The gait-analysis backend requires being logged in as the account that
  originally recorded the session, so the pipeline currently has to log in as that user each run.
- **No direct motion-file import.** Raw motion files can't be imported straight into OpenCap —
  inverse kinematics has to be re-run manually to regenerate marker positions, and the
  resulting timescale/resolution don't line up cleanly with the original recording.
- **Manual file selection.** Selecting which Xsens/OpenCap folder to convert still requires
  typing exact folder names; there's no directory picker or cycling through a folder of trials
  yet.
- **Tight coupling to local/manual execution.** Large parts of the current workflow are
  intertwined with running code interactively in a local console, which makes batch automation
  difficult without a rework.

## Recent progress

- Added the ability to download session data directly (instead of only working from a
  pre-downloaded zip) and to re-evaluate past sessions.
- Moved the main trial-selection while-loop so it no longer re-lists/re-prompts on every pass
  when running multiple trials back to back.
- Vendored the OpenCap `opencap-processing` codebase into this repo and overlaid the
  Synergy-specific edits (`utils.py`, `utilsKinematics.py`, `Examples/gaitAnalysis-UCM.py`).
- Replaced pipeline step 1 (the manual MATLAB joint-mapping + `getMarkers.py`'s
  forward-kinematics marker-reconstruction workaround) with `xsens_to_opensim.py`, built on
  OpenSim's own OpenSense framework. Also writes `.trc` marker files directly (no MATLAB, no
  marker round-trip) and can write output straight into an existing OpenCap session's own
  folder layout. `getMarkers.py`, `utils_UCM.py`, and `utilsKinematics_UCM.py` were removed as
  dead weight once superseded — see `VENDORING.md` for the full history and reasoning.
- `gait_analysis_UCM.py` (the gait-cycle scoring class) has been supplied. A bug-fixed copy,
  `gait_analysis_UCM_fixed.py`, addresses issues found in review — see `VENDORING.md`.

## Status

The OpenCap base is vendored in and the known Synergy-specific edits are layered on top. See
`VENDORING.md` for what's still missing before this runs end to end.
